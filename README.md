# CHI_DeepTreeSketch

This is the official repository of paper "DeepTreeSketch: Neural Graph Prediction for Faithful 3D Tree Modeling from Sketches".

## 1. Tree Dataset
In the very beginning, we implemented a very comprehensive 'Parametric L-system algorithm' for creating diverse 3D tree models automatically as the training dataset.

**1.1. Noted that**: apart from our CHI submission, my implemented algorithm has been used by a few top-tier papers to generate training dataset as well, including a recent **SIGGRAPH Asia** paper:

> **TreePartNet: Neural Decomposition of Point Clouds for 3D Tree Reconstruction.**
>
> SIGGRAPH Asia 2021 (ACM Transactions on Graphics). [[Papar]](https://vcc.tech/research/2021/TreePartNet) 


Please see their Acknowledgement section for some proof that my codes was used:

## 2. Codes and Software:


We are currently working on a online version software that enables people from all over the world can freely explore our modeling system.
Ideally, we will publish the system by March (around after ACM UIST's deadline).
