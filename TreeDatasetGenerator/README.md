## My Software - "Tree Dataset Generator".

:hearts: We also provided **our software** that we developed for automatically generating the 3D tree models. This is a clean version tool and you can use it to easily get different 3D tree variants of a specifed species.

- **Download Link:**
  - Please download our tool (light-weight version) under this **[folder](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/CHITreeProject/tree/main/TreeDatasetGenerator)**.

- **Requirement:**
  - Your should install **Visual Studio 2019+** on your PC. **Qt 5.8+** is also an option, but you only need one of them.
  - Also, just in case of unexpected errors, we strongly suggest to install **CMake** [[link]](https://cmake.org/download/) and **OpenGL** (for 3D visualization) [[link]](https://www.opengl.org/) into your system path, even though they are often not strictly required (because some PC may already have installed them by default).
  - Note that, this tool is only compiled for **Windows System (win10+)**. *Mac* is not supported.

- **Usage:**
  - Double click the **``Tree_Dataset_Generator.exe``** to run this problem.
  - You can re-generate a new random tree model by simply pressing the button **``Get New Tree``**.
  - Also you can change the tree species through the ComboBox (droplist).

- If you encounter any issues on using my dataset, please feel free to contact me at any time.
