## My software: "Tree Dataset Generator".

:hearts: We also provided **our software** that we developed for automatically generating the tree models. 

- **Download Link:** Please download our tool (light-weight version) under this **[folder](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/CHITreeProject/tree/main/TreeDatasetGenerator)**.

- **Requirement:** Your should install **Visual Studio 2019+** in your PC. Also, we suggest to add **CMake** [[link]](https://cmake.org/download/) into your system path, even though it is not strictly required. Note that, this tool is only compiled for **Windows system**.

- **Usage:** Double click the **``Tree_Dataset_Generator.exe``** to run this problem. You can re-generate a new random tree model by simply pressing the button **``Get New Tree``**. Also you can change the tree species through the ComboBox (droplist).
